# Astah Rich Document Plug-In

Astah allow to document model elements using the definition field. However, the current implementation only allows entering of text,
but does not support rich formatting. The Astah Rich Document Plug-In allows the user to use custom formatting (bold, italic, color, etc.)
for documenting the model elements. 

The plugin reuses the same field, but uses HTML to support formatting.
